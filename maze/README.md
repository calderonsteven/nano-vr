# A Maze Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## GVR Changes
I changed the RETICLE_DISTANCE_MAX variable in GvrReticlePointer.cs from 10 to 50 in order to make the raycast longer

## Notes
No build.zip added because is not required in http://www.udacityvr.com/how-to-submit-a-unity-project
